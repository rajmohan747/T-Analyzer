The gas sensors used for this project are MQ2,MQ3,MQ4,MQ5.Sensors are powered from Arduino Mega and the analog values are read with the analog pins.
Power up the transmitter circuitry and read the sensor values using the android application 'Serial Bluetooth Terminal'

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.kai_morich.serial_bluetooth_terminal&hl=en

Using the application,'Serial Bluetooth Terminal' keep a log of the values in the environment under observation.
Take log for 5-6 hours.Once the values are obtained,using k-means find the cluster centroids.

Use k_means.py for finding the cluster centroids.

It will produce cluster centroid values for 'GOOD' and 'WORSE' conditions.
Update the centroid values in the Arduino code,transmitter.ino 


Set up the receiver section according to the Arduino Sketch given.
Upload the code receiver.ino in the Arduino
You can use either RGB led strips or 16*2 lcd display or buzzers for the alerts on worse conditions.
Update the receiver circuit and receiver.ino code accordingly.
