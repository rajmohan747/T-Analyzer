# T-Analyzer
Project which is used to analyze and detect various odour levels in rest rooms/toilets. It consists of various gas sensors like MQ2,MQ3,MQ5,MQ6,MQ135 for detecting different gaseous componenets in the environment. The sensor values were logged for 5 hours and k-means clustering was done for classifying the values into two different regions. Depending on the average distance of the new sensor values from the centroid values,the condition in the restroom would be analyzed. Based on the different odour level detected,the display color of LED indicator placed outside the toilet changes. The communication across the transmitter and receiver module happens across NRF module. Arduino UNO was used as the main controller for the transmitter and receiver
